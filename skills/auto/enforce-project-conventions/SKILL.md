description: Use when creating or updating project files to ensure compliance with strict formatting, schema, and documentation rules.

1. Before writing any output file, verify the exact schema requirements: check for mandatory top-level keys (e.g., "schema_version": 2, "generated_by": "log-triage", "meta": {...}), specific data types (e.g., integer cents for money), and naming conventions (e.g., lower-case service names with underscores instead of hyphens).
2. When generating JSON output, explicitly construct the object to include all required metadata blocks and ensure all values are formatted as specified (e.g., timestamps as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, money as integers).
3. If the task involves modifying a package, ensure every public function (not starting with '_') has type annotations for all parameters and the return value.
4. If the task involves fixing bugs, create a `tests/test_regressions.py` file containing at least one test function per bug fixed (minimum 3 total) and ensure it passes.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` by adding a bullet point `- fix(<function_name>): <short description>` under the `## Unreleased` heading for every fix performed (minimum 3 bullets).
6. Never modify existing files in `tests/` unless explicitly required; add new test files instead.
7. Self-check: Did I include all required metadata keys? Are all money values integers? Are all public functions typed? Is the changelog updated? Are there 3+ regression tests in a new file?
